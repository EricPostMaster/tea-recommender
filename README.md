# Tea Recommender System

Welcome to my tea recommender repo! Because this is a pretty new project, the README is serving as a development journal of sorts. Once the project is complete, I'll put it elsewhere in the repo and replace it with something more like I have in my other repos (check them out!).

**7/3/22 - A repo at last!**  
I've been working on this project for several days now (maybe two weeks?). Late last night I made my first visualization showing both teas and reviewers where the two different entities are different colors, so I was really about that. It's in the working notebook if you want to check it out.

Today I decided to make a proper GitHub repo so I can share this and my progress over time. I still want to create functions for scraping, probably within a class of some sort so I can easily create new instances to grow the dataset/update data. However, because I want to keep up momentum and make progress on an MVP, I'm going to switch gears now and start using the Surprise library to make some recommender models. A recommender system was my original goal with this project, so I'm excited to get going on it! I'm also looking forward to incorporating elements of network analysis into the recommendations to see how that might make the model more interesting.
